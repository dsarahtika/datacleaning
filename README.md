# Data Cleaning
Hello. I made this repository to demonstrate my data cleaning skills in R and Python. 

I am aware that this repository might not be the “fanciest” to be showcased. The point of this repository is to demonstrate the steps necessary in data cleaning—which is an integral stage in any data science project—in hopes that fellow aspiring data scientists/data science students would benefit from this. 

Here you can find two data cleaning processes using two different datasets. For your information, these were assignments from Dibimbing.id’s bootcamp program, which I am currently participating in. 

Both processes share similar steps. However, differences can be found in some methods, such as those for standardization and outlier handling.

## R Data Cleaning

The dataset used for this process is the train data of [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from Kaggle.

The steps taken:

1. Missing Value Checking and Handling
2. Normalization and Standardization
3. Data Transformation
4. Outlier Handling
5. Categorical Data Handling
6. Final Output Combination

You will find more detailed descriptions of each step in the R script. 

## Python Data Cleaning

The dataset was sourced from [Telco Consumer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle.

The steps taken:
1. Data Identification
2. Missing Value Checking and Handling
3. Checking for Duplicates
4. Checking for Outliers
5. Categorical Data Encoding
6. Numerical Data Scaling

Again, please read through the Google Colab notebook for the details.
